## üìò Abstract

**Entroverse Theory** proposes that parallel universes can interact thermodynamically through **entropy gradients**, allowing the flow of energy from high-entropy (decaying) universes to low-entropy (young) ones. This speculative model reframes the multiverse as a **self-regulating entropy ecosystem**, where universes exchange energy via temporary connections known as **entropic bridges**. These bridges arise from extreme entropy imbalances, enabling interuniversal energy flow without violating conservation laws.

## üî¨ Core Assumptions

1. **Multiverse Existence:** The multiverse contains numerous parallel universes, each with its own entropy trajectory.

2. **Cross-Universal Entropy:** Entropy is not strictly local. A multiversal entropy field allows for measurable gradients between universes.

3. **Entropic Bridges:** Under specific conditions, universes with large entropy differences may form temporary connections that enable energy exchange.

4. **Energy Conservation:** Total energy and entropy are conserved across the multiverse, even as they redistribute between universes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Theoretical Mechanism

When a high-entropy universe (Universe A) exists adjacent to a low-entropy universe (Universe B), the entropy differential \( \Delta S = S_A - S_B \) may exceed a critical threshold.

This allows for the formation of an **entropic bridge**, enabling energy to flow from Universe A into Universe B‚Äîmuch like heat flows from hot to cold systems.

The result:
- **Universe A** decays further, contributing its remaining energy.
- **Universe B** gains usable energy, potentially rejuvenating or extending its cosmological timeline.

## üîÅ Key Implications

- **Universe Rejuvenation:** Energy from older universes can sustain or restart younger ones.
- **Entropy Ecosystem:** The multiverse functions as a thermodynamic system where energy is recycled.
- **Anomaly Detection:** The theory suggests possible future observations
# SEBT-research
A bold new theory that reimagines the multiverse as a thermodynamic network‚Äîwhere entropy is not just a local phenomenon but a driving force of interuniversal interaction.
